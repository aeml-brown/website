A primary goal of our research is to understand the mechanistic basis of flight in bats.  In addition to teaching us how bats fly, this understanding is vital to understanding how flight originated and then diversified within the bat lineage. It helps us interpret the similarities and differences in the evolution of flight among bats, birds, pterosaurs, and insects, and elucidates facets of the ecology and physiology of flying animals. Flying animals share characteristics dictated by the constraints of physics, and our research program seeks to delineate the aspects of the structure, physiology, and mechanics of bats and their wings that distinctively shape bat flight.
